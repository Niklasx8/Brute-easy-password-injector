first of all you need to get to a login where u only need to enter a password. Then open ur console of the browser and paste the code from 2.1. file in there then paste the dictionary from 2.3. in there. Now you can easily start the process with the command tryCombinations(dictionary) and then press enter. most of the websites will block this feature but few of them not. In my most used passwords are only 50. You can use any list but you need to write it like this: "password",
